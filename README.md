##Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
###Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find how successful the plays were based on funding goals and their launch dates in the Kickstarter data.  By analyzing this small subset of data we are able to fact find by analyzing time over the metric. 
##Analysis and Challenges 
###Analysis and Outcomes based on Launch date
The analysis was performed by using (countifs) to filter the large dataset into a more specific information.  
###Analysis and Outcomes based on Goals
In the analysis of “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date” the use of a pivot table made it easy to extract outcomes based on launch.  Only small difficulties arose from executing the functions but became easier as more practice was aquired.   
##Results 
Two conclusions that were made from analyzing “Theater outcomes by launch date” were that the most successful launches occurred in May.  And secondly, there was a tendency for all outcomes of launches decreased in December.  In the “Outcomes based on goals” analysis the most successful plays were in the goal range of $1000 to $4999.  Limitations of this dataset include not knowing how the data was collected.
